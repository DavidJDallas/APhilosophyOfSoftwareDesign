2 approaches to fight complexity:
(1) Eliminate complexity by making code simpler and more obvious.
(2) Encapsulate it, so that programmers can work on a system without being exposed to all the complexity at once. 

The second approach is called modular design. Here, a software system is divided into modules, such as classes.
